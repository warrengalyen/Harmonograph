# Harmonograph
A simple harmonogram plotter

A harmonograph is a device made out of 2 or more pendulums that drive a pen or a sheet of paper in a given direction.

Given an amplitude (A), a frequency (f), a phase (p) and a damping coefficient (d) for each pendulum, a pattern is drawn on the canevas. 
I can change the 4 coefficients thanks to sliders on the SFML Window, and the curve gets updated in real time.

When the frequencies are multiples, we obtain very interesting and diverse patterns.
